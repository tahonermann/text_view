<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>C++11 <sup><a href="#ref_cxx11">[C++11]</a></sup> added support for new
character types
<sup><a href="#ref_n2249">[N2249]</a></sup> and Unicode string literals
<sup><a href="#ref_n2442">[N2442]</a></sup>, but neither C++11, nor more recent
standards have provided means of efficiently and conveniently enumerating code
points in Unicode or legacy encodings.  While it is possible to implement such
enumeration using interfaces provided in the standard
<tt>&lt;locale&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;codecvt&gt;</tt> libraries, doing
so is awkward, requires that text be provided as pointers to contiguous memory,
and inefficent due to virtual function call overhead.

<p>The described library provides iterator and range based interfaces for
encoding and decoding strings in a variety of character encodings.  The
interface is intended to support all modern and legacy character encodings,
though implementations are expected to only provide support for a limited set
of encodings.

<p>An example usage follows. Note that \u00F8 (LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE)
is encoded as UTF-8 using two code units (\xC3\xB8), but iterator based
enumeration sees just the single code point.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
using CT = utf8_encoding::character_type;
auto tv = make_text_view&lt;utf8_encoding&gt;(u8"J\u00F8erg");
auto it = tv.begin();
assert(*it++ == CT{0x004A}); // 'J'
assert(*it++ == CT{0x00F8}); // 'ø'
assert(*it++ == CT{0x0065}); // 'e'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The provided iterators and views are compatible with the non-modifying sequence
utilities provided by the standard C++ <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> library.
This enables use of standard algorithms to search encoded text.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
it = std::find(tv.begin(), tv.end(), CT{0x00F8});
assert(it != tv.end());
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The iterators also provide access to the underlying code unit sequence.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
auto base_it = it.base_range().begin();
assert(*base_it++ == '\xC3');
assert(*base_it++ == '\xB8');
assert(base_it == it.base_range().end());
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>These ranges satisfy the requirements for use in C++11 range-based for
statements.  This support is currently limited to views constructed for
stateless encodings as a sentinel type is used as the end iterator for
stateful encodings.  This limitation will be removed if P0184R0
<sup><a href="#ref_p0184r0">[P0184R0]</a></sup> is adopted.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
for (const auto&amp; ch : tv) {
  ...
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation and Scope</h1>

<p>Consider the following code to search for the occurrence of U+00F8 in the
UTF-8 encoded string using C++ standard provided interfaces.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
std::string s = u8"J\u00F8erg";
std::mbstate_t state = std::mbstate_t{};
codecvt_utf8&lt;char32_t&gt; utf8_converter;
const char *from_begin = s.data();
const char *from_end = s.data() + s.size();
const char *from_current;
const char *from_next = from_begin;
char32_t to[1];
std::codecvt_base::result r;
do {
    from_current = from_next;
    char32_t *to_begin = &amp;to[0];
    char32_t *to_end = &amp;to[1];
    char32_t *to_next;
    r = utf8_converter.in(
        state,
        from_current, from_end, from_next,
        to_begin, to_end, to_next);
} while (r != std::codecvt_base::error &amp;&amp; to[0] != char32_t{0x00F8});
if (r != std::codecvt_base::error &amp;&amp; to[0] == char32_t{0x00F8}) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Found at offset " &lt;&lt; (from_current - from_begin) &lt;&lt; endl;
} else {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Not found" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of issues with the above code:

<ul>
  <li>It is verbose.</li>
  <li>It is limited to working with strings that are stored in contiguous
      memory.</li>
  <li>It is inefficient.  All <tt>codecvt</tt> public member functions
      dispatch to virtual member functions.
  <li>It is not generic.  Use of the <tt>codecvt_utf8</tt> facet makes it
      specific to handling of UTF-8 encoded text.  Making this code generic
      would require some other means of identifying an appropriate facet to
      use.</li>
  <li>It is not applicable to non-Unicode encodings; <tt>codecvt</tt>
      doesn't provide means to retrieve a code point for the encodings used
      for ordinary and wide strings.  The above code only accomplishes this
      by depending on transcoding to UTF-32 and the fact that UTF-32 is a
      trivial encoding.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above method is not the only method available to identify a search term
in an encoded string.  For some encodings, it is feasible to encode the search
term in the encoding and to search for a matching code unit sequence.  This
approach works for UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, but not for many other encodings.
Consider the Shift-JIS encoding of U+6D6C.  This is encoded as 0x8A 0x5C.
Shift-JIS is a multibyte encoding that is almost ASCII compatible.  The code
unit sequence 0x5C encodes the ASCII '\' character.  But note that 0x5C appears
as the second byte of the code unit sequence for U+6D6C.  Naively searching for
the matching code unit sequence for '\' would incorrectly match the trailing
code unit sequence for U+6D6C.

<p>The library described here is intended to solve the above issues while also
providing a modern interface that is intuitive to use and can be used with
other standard provided facilities; in particular, the C++ standard
<tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> library.

<h1 id="terminology">Terminology</h1>

<p>The terminology used in this document is intended to be consistent with
industry standards and, in particular, the Unicode standard.  Any
inconsistencies in the use of this terminology and that in the Unicode standard
is unintentional.  The terms described in this document comprise a subset of the
terminology used within the Unicode standard; only those terms necessary to
specify functionality exhibited by the proposed library are included here.
Those who would like to learn more about general text processing terminology in
computer systems are encouraged to read chapter 2, "General Structure" of the
Unicode standard.

<h2 id="term_code_unit">Code Unit</h2>

<p>A single, indivisible, integral element of an encoded sequence of characters.
A sequence of one or more code units specifies a code point or encoding state
transition as defined by a character encoding.  A code unit does not, by itself,
identify any particular character or code point; the meaning ascribed to a
particular code unit value is derived from a character encoding definition.

<p>The <tt>char</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>, and
<tt>char32_t</tt> types are most commonly used as code unit types.

<p>The string literal <tt>u8"J\u00F8erg"</tt> contains 7 code units and 6
code unit sequences; <tt>"\u00F8"</tt> is encoded in UTF-8 using two code
units and string literals contain a trailing NUL code unit.

<p>The string literal <tt>"J\u00F8erg"</tt> contains an implementation
defined number of code units.  The standard does not specify the encoding of
ordinary and wide string literals, so the number of code units encoded by
<tt>"\u00F8"</tt> depends on the implementation defined encoding used for
ordinary string literals.

<h2 id="term_code_point">Code Point</h2>

<p>An integral value denoting an abstract character as defined by a character
set.  A code point does not, by itself, identify any particular character; the
meaning ascribed to a particular code point value is derived from a character
set definition.

<p>The <tt>char</tt>, <tt>wchar_t</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>, and
<tt>char32_t</tt> types are most commonly used as code point types.

<p>The string literal <tt>u8"J\u00F8erg"</tt> describes a sequence of 6
code point values; string literals implicitly specify a trailing NUL code point.

<p>The string literal <tt>"J\u00F8erg"</tt> describes a sequence of an
implementation defined number of code point values.  The standard does not
specify the encoding of ordinary and wide string literals, so the number of
code points encoded by <tt>"\u00F8"</tt> depends on the implementation
defined encoding used for ordinary string literals.  Implementations are
permitted to translate a single code point in the source or Unicode character
sets to multiple code points in the execution encoding.

<h2 id="term_character_set">Character Set</h2>

<p>A mapping of code point values to abstract characters.  A character set need
not provide a mapping for every possible code point value representable by the
code point type.

<p>C++ does not specify the use of any particular character set or encoding for
ordinary and wide character and string literals, though it does place some
restrictions on them.  Unicode character and string literals are governed by the
Unicode standard.

<p>Common character sets include ASCII, Unicode, and Windows code page 1252.

<h2 id="term_character">Character</h2>

<p>An element of written language, for example, a letter, number, or symbol.  A
character is identified by the combination of a character set and a code point
value.

<h2 id="term_encoding">Encoding</h2>

<p>A method of representing a sequence of characters as a sequence of code unit
sequences.

<p>An encoding may be stateless or stateful.  In stateless encodings, characters
may be encoded or decoded starting from the beginning of any code unit sequence.
In stateful encodings, it may be necessary to record certain affects of
previously encoded characters in order to correctly encode additional
characters, or to decode preceding code unit sequences in order to correctly
decode following code unit sequences.

<p>An encoding may be fixed width or variable width.  In fixed width encodings,
all characters are encoded using a single code unit sequence and all code unit
sequences have the same length.  In variable width encodings, different
characters may require multiple code unit sequences, or code unit sequences of
varying length.

<p>An encoding may support bidirectional or random access decoding of code unit
sequences.  In bidirectional encodings, characters may be decoded by traversing
code unit sequences in reverse order.  Such encodings must support a method to
identify the start of a preceding code unit sequence.  In random access
encodings, characters may be decoded from any code unit sequence within the
sequence of code unit sequences, in constant time, without having to decode any
other code unit sequence.  Random access encodings are necessarily stateless
and fixed length.  An encoding that is neither bidirectional, nor random
access, may only be decoded by traversing code unit sequences in forward order.

<p>An encoding may support encoding characters from multiple character sets.
Such an encoding is either stateful and defines code unit sequences that switch
the active character set, or defines code unit sequences that implicitly
identify a character set, or both.

<p>A trivial encoding is one in which all encoded characters correspond to a
single character set and where each code unit encodes exactly one character
using the same value as the code point for that character.  Such an encoding is
stateless, fixed width, and supports random access decoding.

<p>Common encodings include the Unicode UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings, the
ISO/IEC 8859 series of encodings including ISO/IEC 8859-1, and many trivial
encodings such as Windows code page 1252.

<h1 id="design_considerations">Design Considerations</h1>

<h2 id="iterator_requirements">Iterator Requirements</h2>

<p>The iterators provided by this library do not conform to all of the
C++ standard requirements for forward and random access iterators.

<p>Each iterator holds its own copy of decoded code point values, two iterators
that compare equally will return different addresses when dereferenced.  The
standard requires that equivalent iterators return equivalent reference and
pointer addresses when dereferenced.  For random access iterators,
<tt>operator[]</tt> returns a value type since any returned reference type
would immediately become dangling.

<p>The above conformance issues will be resolved if the proxy iterators
proposal <sup><a href="#ref_p0022r1">[P0022R1]</a></sup> is accepted.

<h2 id="view_requirements">View Requirements</h2>

<p>The <tt>basic_text_view</tt> and <tt>itext_iterator</tt> class
templates are parameterized on a view type that provides access to the
underlying code unit sequence.  <tt>make_text_view</tt> and the various
type aliases of <tt>basic_text_view</tt> are required to choose a view type
to select a specialization of these class templates.  The C++ standard library
doesn't currently define a suitable view type, though the need for one has been
recognized.  N3350 <sup><a href="#ref_n3350">[N3350]</a></sup> proposed a
<tt>std::range</tt> class template to fill this need and the ranges proposal
<sup><a href="#ref_n4560">[N4560]</a></sup> states (C.2, "Iterator Range
Type") that a future paper will propose such a type.

<p>The technical specification in this paper leaves the view type selected by
<tt>make_text_view</tt> and the type aliases of <tt>basic_text_view</tt>
up to the implementation.  It would have been possible to define a suitable
view type as part of this library, but the author felt it better to wait until
a suitable type becomes available as part of either the ranges proposal or the
standard library.

<h2 id="error_handling">Error Handling</h2>

<p>The reference implementation currently throws exceptions when underflow
occurs or when invalid code unit sequences are encountered.  Use of exceptions
is not acceptable by many members of the C++ community.

<p>An alternative to exceptions has not yet been settled on.  One possibility
is to add an additional template parameter to the basic_text_view and
itext_iterator class templates that enables alternative error handling to
be implemented.  Custom error handlers could then substitute replacement
characters and/or record errors via some other mechanism.

<h2 id="encoding_orientation">Encoding Forms vs Encoding Schemes</h2>

<p>The Unicode standard differentiates code unit oriented and byte oriented
encodings.  The former are termed encoding forms; the latter, encoding schemes.
This library provides support for some of each.  For example,
<tt>utf16_encoding</tt> is code unit oriented; the value type of its
iterators is <tt>char16_t</tt>.  The <tt>utf16be_encoding</tt>,
<tt>utf16le_encoding</tt>, and <tt>utf16bom_encoding</tt> encodings
are byte oriented; the value type of their iterators is <tt>char</tt>.

<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>

<p>Decoding from a streaming source without unacceptably blocking on underflow
requires the ability to decode a partial code unit sequence, save state,
and then resume decoding the remainder of the code unit sequence when more
data becomes available.  This requirement presents challenges for an iterator
based approach.  The specification presented in this paper does not provide
a good solution for this use case.

<p>One possibility is to add additional state tracking that is stored with
each iterator.  Support for the possibility of trailing non-code-point
encoding code unit sequences (escape sequences in some encodings) already
requires that code point iterators greedily consume code units.  This enables
an iterator to compare equal to the end iterator even when its current base
code unit iterator does not equal the end iterator of the underlying code
unit range.  Storing partial code unit sequence state with an iterator that
compares equal to the end iterator would enable users to write code like the
following.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
using encoding = utf8_encoding;
auto state = encoding::initial_state();
do {
  std::string b = get_more_data();
  auto tv = make_text_view&lt;encoding&gt;(state, begin(b), end(b));
  auto it = begin(tv);
  while (it != end(tv))
    ...;
  state = it; // Trailing state is preserved in the end iterator.  Save it
              // to seed state for the next loop iteration.
} while (!b.empty());
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this leaves open the possibility for trailing code units at the
end of an encoded text to go unnoticed.  In a non-buffering scenario, an
iterator might silently compare equal to the end iterator even though there
are (possibly invalid) code units remaining.

<p>It might be feasible to address this by adding a policy template parameter
to basic_text_view and itext_iterator similiar to what is discussed in the
<a href="#error_handling">error handling</a> section.

<h2 id="char_types">Character types</h2>

<p>This library defines a character class template parameterized by character
set type used to represent character values.  The purpose of this class
template is to make explicit the association of a code point value and a
character set.

<p>It has been suggested that <tt>char32_t</tt> be supported as a character
type that is implicitly associated with the Unicode character set and that
values of this type always be interpreted as Unicode code point values.  This
suggestion is intended to enable UTF-32 string literals to be directly usable
as sequences of character values (in addition to being sequences of code unit
and code point values).  This has a cost in that it prohibits use of the
<tt>char32_t</tt> type as a code unit or code point type for other
encodings.  Non-Unicode encodings, including the encodings used for ordinary
and wide string literals, would still require a distinct character type (such
as a specialization of the character class template) so that the correct
character set can be inferred from objects of the character type.

<p>This suggestion raises concerns for the author.  To a certain degree, it can
be accommodated by removing the current members of the character class template
in favor of free functions and type trait templates.  However, it results in
ambiguities when enumerating the elements of a UTF-32 string literal; are the
elements code point or character values?  Well, the answer would be both (and
code unit values as well).  This raises the potential for inadvertently
writing (generic) code that confuses code points and characters, runs as
expected for UTF-32 encodings, but fails to compile for other encodings.  The
author would prefer to enforce correct code via the type system and is unaware
of any particular benefits that the ability to treat UTF-32 string literals
as sequences of character type would bring.

<p>It has also been suggested that <tt>char32_t</tt> might suffice as the
only character type; that decoding of any encoded string include implicit
transcoding to Unicode code points.  The author believes that this suggestion
is not feasible for several reasons:

<ol>
  <li>Some encodings use character sets that define characters such that round
      trip transcoding to Unicode and back fails to preserve the original code
      point value.  For example, Shift-JIS (Microsoft code page 932) defines
      duplicate code points for the same character for compatibility with IBM
      and NEC character set extensions.<br/>
      <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/170559">
      https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/170559</a></li>
  <li>Transcoding to Unicode for all non-Unicode encodings would carry
      non-negligible performance costs and would pessimize platforms such as
      IBM's z/OS that use EBCIDC by default for the non-Unicode execution
      character sets.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="locale_dependencies">Locale Dependent Encodings</h2>

<p>The ordinary and wide execution character sets are locale dependent; the
interpretation of code point values that do not correspond to characters of the
basic ordinary and wide execution character sets is determined at
run-time based on locale settings.  Yet, ordinary and wide string literals
may contain universal-character-name designators that are transcoded at
compile-time to some character set that is a superset of the corresponding
basic character set and assumed to be a subset of the execution character set.
These compile-time extended character sets are not currently named in the C++
standard.

<p>Some compilers allow these compile-time extended character sets to be
specified by command line options.  For example, gcc supports
<tt>-fexec-charset=</tt> and <tt>-fwide-exec-charset=</tt> options
and Microsoft Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 CTP recently added
the <tt>/execution-charset:</tt> and <tt>/utf-8</tt> options.  More
information on these options can be found at:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-5.3.0/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html#Preprocessor-Options">
      https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-5.3.0/gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html#Preprocessor-Options</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/02/22/new-options-for-managing-character-sets-in-the-microsoft-cc-compiler/">
      https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/02/22/new-options-for-managing-character-sets-in-the-microsoft-cc-compiler/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <tt>execution_character_encoding</tt> and
<tt>execution_wide_character_encoding</tt> type aliases defined by this
library refer to encodings that use these unnamed character sets that are
known at compile-time.  This choice is motivated by future intentions to enable
compile-time string manipulation and to allow avoiding the performance overhead
of run-time locale awareness when an application is not locale dependent.

<p>Though not currently specified, it may be appropriate to define additional
encoding classes that implement locale awareness.  It may also be more
appropriate for the <tt>execution_character_encoding</tt> and
<tt>execution_wide_character_encoding</tt> type aliases to refer to these
locale dependent encodings and to introduce different names to refer to the
extended compile-time execution encodings that are not currently named by the
C++ standard.

<h2 id="future_transcoding">Transcoding</h2>

<p>Transcoding between encodings that use the same character set is currently
possible.  The following example transcodes a UTF-8 string to UTF-16.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
std::string in = get_a_utf8_string();
std::u16string out;
std::back_insert_iterator&lt;std::u16string&gt; out_it{out};
auto tv_in = make_text_view&lt;utf8_encoding&gt;(in);
auto tv_out = make_otext_iterator&lt;utf16_encoding&gt;(out_it);
std::copy(tv_in.begin(), tv_in.end(), tv_out);
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Transcoding between encodings that use different character sets is not
currently supported due to lack of interfaces to transcode a code point
from one character set to the code point of a different one.

<p>Additionally, naively transcoding between encodings using std::copy()
works, but is not optimal; techniques are known to accelerate transcoding
between some sets of encoding.  For example, SIMD instructions can be
utilized in some cases to transcode multiple code points in parallel.

<p>Future work is intended to enable optimized transcoding and transcoding
between distinct character sets.

<h2 id="future_constexpr">Constexpr Support</h2>

<p>Encodings that are not dependent on run-time support could conceivably
support code point enumeration and transcoding to other encodings at compile
time.  This could be useful to conveniently provide text in alternative
encodings at compile-time to meet requirements of external interfaces without
incurring run-time overhead, having to write the string with hex escape
sequences, or having to rely on preprocessing or other build time tools.

<p>An example would be to provide a string in Modified UTF-8 for use in a JNI
application.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
auto tv = "Text with \0 embedded NUL"_modified_utf8;
// equivalent to:
auto tv = make_text_view&lt;modified_utf8_encoding&gt;(
              "Text with \xC0\x80 embedded NUL");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, user defined literals (UDLs) are currently unable to provide
this support; though a constexpr UDL operator can be written, there is no known
way to write the UDL such that an arbitrarily sized compile-time data structure
can be returned, nor is there a way to instantitate a static buffer for the
resulting transformation on a per string literal basis.

<p>However, it is possible to perform string transformations at compile-time
using a template constexpr function; so long as is is acceptable for the
translated string to be embedded in another data structure.

<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
template&lt;int N&gt;
struct my_str {
    char code_units[N];
};

template&lt;int N&gt;
constexpr my_str&lt;N&gt; make_my_str(const char (&amp;str)[N]) {
    my_str&lt;N&gt; ms{};
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i) {
        char cu = str[i] ? str[i] + 1 : 0;
        ms.code_units[i] = cu;
    }
    return ms;
}

constexpr auto ms = make_my_str("text"); // ms.code_units[] == "ufyu"
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>One caveat of this approach is that the returned data structure owns the
code unit sequence and is therefore more container-like than view-like.

<p>Core language enhancements are probably necessary to make compile-time string
literal translations a usable feature.

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="faq_explicit_encodings">
    Why do I have to specify the encoding for string literals?</h2>

<p>This question refers to code like this:
<blockquote class="code">
<pre><code>
auto tv = make_text_view&lt;utf8_encoding&gt;(u8"A UTF-8 string");
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The argument to make_text_view() is a UTF-8 string literal.  The compiler
knows that it is a UTF-8 string.  Yet, make_text_view() requires the encoding
to be explicitly specified via a template argument.  Why?

<p>The answer is that ordinary and UTF-8 string literals have the same type;
array of <tt>const char</tt>.  The library is unable to implicitly determine
an encoding for the provided string.

<p>If a <tt>char8_t</tt> type were to be added to the type system and UTF-8
string literals were to be changed to reflect that type (with appropriate
accommodations for backward compatibility), then it would be possible to
assume (not infer) an encoding based on type for all five of the encodings the
standard states must be provided.

<h2 id="faq_custom_encodings">
    Can I define my own encodings?  If so, How?</h2>

<p>Yes.  To do so, you'll need to define character set and encoding classes
appropriate for your encoding.

  <li>Text encoded by the aliased encoding can be decoded by the compatibility
      encoding when encoded characters are restricted to members of the
      character set of the compatibility encoding.</li>
</ol>

<p>These compatibility requirements allow implementation freedom to use
encodings that provide features beyond the minimum requirements imposed on the
compatibility encodings by the standard.  For example, the encoding aliased by
<tt>execution_character_encoding</tt> is allowed to support characters that
are not members of the character set of the
<tt>basic_execution_character_encoding</tt>

<p>The encoding aliased by <tt>execution_character_encoding</tt> must be

<p>Member functions provide access to the stored encoding state, the underlying
code unit iterator, and, when <tt>ranges::ForwardIterator</tt> is
satisified, the underlying code unit range for the current character.  The
underlying code unit range is returned with an implementation defined type that
satisfies <tt>ranges::View</tt>.  The <tt>is_ok</tt> member function
returns true if the iterator is dereferenceable as a result of having
successfully decoded a code point (This predicate is used to distinguish between
an input iterator that just successfully decoded the last code point in the code
unit stream as compared to one that was advanced after having done so; in both
cases, the underlying code unit input iterator will compare equal to the end of
the stream iterator).

<p><tt>itext_iterator</tt> is a proxy iterator
<sup><a href="#ref_p0022r1">[P0022R1]</a></sup>
since the value type is computed and a meaningful reference type cannot be
provided for the dereference and subscript operators.  The <tt>reference</tt>
member type is an alias of an implementation defined proxy reference type, must
satisfy <tt>Character</tt>, and must support implicit conversion to <tt>const
value_type&amp;</tt>.

<p>Note: Implementation of a reference proxy would be simplified if the
operator dot proposal <sup><a href="#ref_p0252r0">[P0252R0]</a></sup> is
adopted.

  Text view type aliases</h3>

<p>The <tt>text_view</tt>, <tt>wtext_view</tt>, <tt>u8text_view</tt>,
<tt>u16text_view</tt> and <tt>u32text_view</tt> type aliases reference an
implementation defined specialization of <tt>basic_text_view</tt> for all
five of the encodings the standard states must be provided.

<p>The implementation defined view type used for the underlying code unit
view type must satisfy <tt>ranges::View</tt> and provide iterators of pointer
to the underlying code unit type to contiguous storage.  The intent in
providing these type aliases is to minimize instantiations of the
<tt>basic_text_view</tt> and <tt>itext_iterator</tt> class templates by
encouraging use of common view types with underlying code unit views that
reference contiguous storage, such as views into objects with a type
instantiated from <tt>std::basic_string</tt>.  See further discussion in the
<a href="#view_requirements">View Requirements</a> section.

<p>It is permissible for the <tt>text_view</tt> and <tt>u8text_view</tt> type
aliases to reference the same type.  This will be the case when the execution
character encoding is UTF-8.  Attempts to overload functions based on
<tt>text_view</tt> and <tt>u8text_view</tt> will result in multiple function
definition errors on such implementations.

<h3 id="make_text_view">
  make_text_view</h3>

<p>The <tt>make_text_view</tt> functions enable convenient construction of
<tt>basic_text_view</tt> objects via implicit selection of a view type for the
underlying code unit sequence.

<p>When provided iterators or ranges for contiguous storage, these functions
return a <tt>basic_text_view</tt> specialization type that uses the same
implementation defined view type as for the <tt>basic_text_view</tt> type
aliases as discussed in <a href="#text_view_type_aliases">Text view type
aliases</a>

<p>Overloads are provided to construct <tt>basic_text_view</tt> objects from
iterator and sentinel pairs, iterator and difference pairs, and range or
<tt>std::basic_string</tt> objects.  For each of these overloads, additional
overloads are provided to construct the view with an explicit encoding state
or with an implicit initial encoding state provided by the encoding
<tt>ET</tt>.  Each of these overloads requires that the encoding type be
explicitly specified.

<p>Additional overloads are provided to construct the view from iterator and
sentinel pairs that satisfy <tt>TextIterator</tt> and objects of a type that
satisfies <tt>TextView</tt>.  For these overloads, the encoding type is
deduced and the encoding state is implicitly copied from the arguments.

<p>If <tt>make_text_view</tt> is invoked with an rvalue range, then the lifetime
of the returned object and all copies of it must end with the full-expression
that the <tt>make_text_view</tt> invocation is within.  Otherwise, the returned
object or its copies will hold iterators into a destructed object resulting in
undefined behavior.
